| Using a reusable water bottle instead of plastic      | +5 points per week         | Reduces single-use plastic waste.     |
| Using a cloth bag instead of plastic bags             | +2 points per shopping trip | Prevents unnecessary plastic waste.   |
| Donating clothes instead of discarding them          | +10 points per donation     | Extends the lifecycle of textiles.    |
